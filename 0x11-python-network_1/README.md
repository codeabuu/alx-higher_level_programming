You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable

10. Time for an interview!
#advanced
The Holberton School staff evaluates candidates applying for a back-end position with multiple technical challenges, like this one:

Please list 10 commits (from the most recent to oldest) of the repository “rails” by the user “rails”
You must use the GitHub API, here is the documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/
Print all commits by: `<sha>: <author name>` (one by line)
Write a Python script that takes 2 arguments in order to solve this challenge.

The first argument will be the repository name
The second argument will be the owner name
You must use the packages requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
Only 17% of applicants for a backend position at Holberton finished this task in less than 15 minutes.
